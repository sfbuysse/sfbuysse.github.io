									</header>
									<p>I'm co-advised by <a href="https://josephslab.github.io/">Emily Josephs</a> and <a href="https://jeffreykconner.com/">Jeff Conner</a> in the Plant Biology department and the Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior Program. I am broadly interested in plant evolution. The main themes in my dissertation work are the evolution of phenotypic plasticity and the interaction of genetic drift and selection in trait loss.</p>

									<h3>Competency 2: What is it called</h3>
									<p>I research plant evolution by using the model organism<em> Arabidopsis thaliana</em>. I'm particularly interested in adaptation to changing climates. My research includes:</p>

											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/flat.jpg" alt="image of plants in pots" /></a>
											<div class="inner">
												<h4>The role of plasticity in adaptation to climate change</h4>
												<p>I am fascinated by the ability of plants to respond to their environment and to adapt to stressful environments. In this project, I am investigating the role of phenotypic plasticity in adpatation to climate change by incorporating within and between population variation in plasticity, selection gradients for plasticity, and quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis to start to uncover the genetic architecture of plasticity for multiple traits. <br />
												The results from this project will be applicable in understanding the effect of assisted migration and imroving crops for climate resiliency.</p>

											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/stamens.jpg" alt="image of short stamens" /></a>
											<div class="inner">
												<h4>Constraint of Trait Loss</h4>
												<p>In this project, I am investigating the roles of genetic drift and selection in trait loss. <em> A. thaliana</em> is highly selfing and previous evidence shows that short stamens do not contribute to fitness. However, short stamens have not been lost. I am investigating why using populations along an elevational gradient in the Spanish Pyrenees.</p>

												<h4>Can we use models to teach science literacy skills? </h4>
												<p>As a Future Academic Scholar in Teaching at MSU, I designed and implemented a teaching as research project that used a modelling activity in an introductory biology lab to emphasize the connections students recognize between science and society. <br />
													The outcome of this project will help us understand the role of physically drawing connections between concepts in students ability to describe the societal context of their lab experiments and if those skills are transfered to more broad assessments of science literacy skills </p>
												
												<p>In addition, I am working to complete a Certificate in College Teaching through the Graduate School at MSU. My portfolio will be updated with my progress towards completing the competencies as I progress through the program. <\p>
