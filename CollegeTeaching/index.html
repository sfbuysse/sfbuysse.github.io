										<h3>Competency 1: Developing Discipline Related Teaching Strategies</h3>

									<p>To complete this competency, I will be taking a Scientific Teaching course in Spring 2024 at MSU. I have already completed online teaching courses including <em> An Introduction to Evidence-Based Undergraduate STEM Teaching </em> and <em> Advanced Learning through Evidence-Based STEM Teaching </em> through the <a href="https://www.stemteachingcourse.org/">CIRTL Network</a>.</p>

										<h3>Competency 2: Creating Effective Learning Environments</h3>
									</header>
									<p>I completed the required work for this competency in May 2023 in a workshop with Dr. Kirstin Parkin.<br />
										Description: In this session, Kirstin shared some of her tips for creating an inclusive learning environment for all students. These include using a QR code sto students can 
										get slides before class without the instructor needing to upload them somewhere. QR codes can also be good ways for students to share something
										with the instructor during the first few days of class. On the first day of class, be sure to genuinely introduce yourself and get to know your students. 
										She also recommends walking around the classroom and always recording class sessions. To be effective in the classroom, it is important that students know what 
										being successful in your course will look like, and all of the course materials should prepare them for success. It is a good idea to use
										examples from your discpline of "final products" such as journal articles or figures to help students understand what scientists
										in your field work with. Dr. Parkin also touched on how to ensure out of class materials are effective for learning. My main takeaway was that prep work for class
										should have a low cognitive load that mianly provides guidance for students and in class work is where higher cognitive load activities should occur.<br />

									<h3>Competency 3: Incorporating Effective Learning Environments</h3>
									<p>I completed the required work for this competency in May 2023 through the "Assessing Student Learning" session with Dr. Rique Campa and the "Technology in Teaching" session with Dr. Stefanie Baier. These concepts were implemented during a working session to develop a classroom activity. Stay tuned for the details to be posted here!</p>

									<h3>Competency 4: Understanding the University Context</h3>
									<p>I completed the required work for this competency in May 2023 by attending a workshop title "The University Context" with
										Dr. Juddith Stoddard from MSU. <br /> 
										Description: In this session, Dr. Stoddard emphasized understand the teaching and learning 
										environment of each university including the physical space you teach in, the support around you, the curriculum, and
										the teaching resources. The material presented in this session emphasized that university context matters when 
										applying for faculty positions and when setting up your classroom. In particular, we focused on how University mission statements 
										are guiding documents, but they do not always match the guidelines a Univeristy has for faculty. Dr. Stoddard discussed how teaching prep work is constant, but teaching load varies
										between departments and appointment types so those are important elements of a job description. Additionally, faculty contracts are typically 9
										months, but there are usually summer positions available.<br /> 
										Reflection: This information is particularly useful as a graduate
										student because I can explore the different unveristy contexts available, and tailor my graduate training to prepare
										me for a job with a univeristy context that fits my goals and teaching philosophy. In particular, this session highlighted
										that knowing how faculty are evaluated at the university you apply to is important in understanding the university context. Parts of this session are 
										also really useful as I begin to draft my teaching philosophy statement because I will want my teaching philosophy to use language
										that matches the University context I am hoping to apply to in a few years. <br />
										Artifacts: slides, coming soon<br />
										Materials Developed: Notes from group project, coming soon</p>

									<h3>Competency 5: Assessing Student Learning</h3>
									<p>This competency will be completed when my FAST project! My project assesses changes in student science literacy after implementing a modeling approach to teach the societal context of science. I have completed the classroom portion of this project, and am waiting to recieve anonymized data from a collaborator. Stay tuned for results!</p>
